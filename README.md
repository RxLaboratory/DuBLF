# DuBLF
 The Duduf Blender Framework

## Relocation notice!

The canonical repository for DuBlast is [on
Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/RxLaboratory/Bluik) but we maintain [a
mirror on GitHub](https://github.com/RxLaboratory/Bluik/tree/master) for the
time being in order to ease the transition. Please update your links
and git remotes.

The repo on github will be left around for a time as a convenience
offered to those who haven't yet created a Codeberg account.
